`HIGHLY RECOMMENDED` 

* It is `highly recommended` that you build your website using `.ipynb` files and NOT `.qmd`files
* Functionally the two formats are basically identical, i.e. they are just `Markdown` + `Code` 
* However there is `ONE MAJOR DIFFERENCE`, i.e. `.ipynb` stores the code outputs in the meta-data of the file
  * This means you `ONLY HAVE TO RUN THE CODE ONCE` with `.ipynb`
  * `.qmd` will run the code every time you build the website, which can be very slow
    * There are `caching` options for `.qmd`, however, they are "messier" that just using `.ipynb`
  * **Note**: `.qmd` is fine if there is no code, in which case it is basically just a `Markdown` file
* Converting between the two
  * You can switch between the two formats using 
  * `quarto convert clustering.qmd` this will output a `.ipynb` version called `clustering.ipynb`
  * `quarto convert eda.ipynb` this will output a `.qmd` version called `eda.qmd`
* YOU CAN RUN `R CODE` IN VSC WITH `.ipynb`, see the following link 
  * [https://saturncloud.io/blog/how-to-use-jupyter-r-kernel-with-visual-studio-code/](https://saturncloud.io/blog/how-to-use-jupyter-r-kernel-with-visual-studio-code/)
* It is possible, but `NOT RECOMMENDED`, to mix Python and R code in the same file


`IMPORTANT ASIDE`

*  A `.ipynb` file is simply a `JSON` file with a specialized structural format
*  You can see this by running `more eda/eda.ipynb` from the command line
* Which will output the following;

`TIP FOR MAC USERS`

* `command+control+shift+4` is very useful on a mac. 
  * It takes a screenshot and saves it to the clip-board 
* The following VSC extension allows you to paste images from the clip-board with `alt+command+v`.

* `tab` is your best friend when using the command line, since it does `auto-completion` 
* `open ./path_to_file` will open any file or directory from the command line
